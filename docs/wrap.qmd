## Questions 

### - What facts or arguments stuck with you? 

### - What surprised you? 

### - How has your thinking changed? 

### - What connections do you see between your op-eds and the readings?

### - If you could waive a magic wand and change one aspect of policy or politics?

## 2: The State of U.S. Climate Policy

> "The hope is that the [Inflation Reduction Act's] bundle of subsidies, tax breaks, infrastructure investment, and market protectionism will unite green-tech boosters with big capital, organized labor, and the beneficiaries of the growth-to-come. If this coalition-building is successful, more green-industrial policy will ensue...Climate is reshaping the terrain on which we will be fighting in the years to come." (Battistoni and Mann)

> 2025 E.O.s: Big governmental support for oil, gas, and mining. Ban offshore wind and redefine wind & solar as not “energy.” End support for water, fuel, or energy efficiency

## Week 3: The Anthropocene Challenge


> "In a purblindness that has marked all of human history before today, nature has been the thing without politics, the home of the principles that come before politics, whether those are the divine right of kings or the equality of all persons." (Purdy, p. 21)

- What is the "Anthropocene challenge" as described by Purdy? 
- What does Purdy mean by politics and anti-politics? What are some examples? 


## Week 3: World Views

- What does Buck mean by the "constructive ambiguity" of net zero? 
- Purdy discusses several forms of environmental imagination/ideology that shaped U.S. environmental policy and the "terrain" on which policy debates unfold. What kind of political terrain does net zero create? 

> We're all living in a giant accounting problem.

> Roberts: "we need to talk about who's going to win and who's going to lose, and the substantial social changes and changes in our culture and practices that we need. We need to bring all these things in. But ... if the accounting framework can sort of trick various and sundry participants and institutions into thinking they're in a value neutral technical discussion, if you can make progress that way, why not do it? Because any richer meta narrative is destined to be more controversial and more produce more political backlash. What do you think about that?

> Buck: "No, I think that the problem is we haven't invested at all in figuring out how to create desire and demand for lower carbon things."

- To what extent have climate movements been effective, and why?
- To what extent are the underlying features of U.S. climate politics outlined by McAdam in 2017 still true?

- How does the Harris campaign's climate plan implicitly define the scope of "climate policy"---what is included and what is left out? 
- How does the Data For Progress implicitly define the scope of "climate policy"---what is included and what is left out? 
- How do the Heritage Foundation's policy proposals implicitly respond to climate change and energy transition?

## Week 7: Ecological Critique

> "The Wilderness Society is, philosophically, a disclaimer of the biotic arrogance of *homo americanus*." (Leopold, cited in Purdy, p. 192)

> "It is a curious feature of environmental politics...that its rhetorical fidelity to the past can trick an observer into overlooking how innovative it is...In this respect, environmental politics resembles many religious traditions and the constitutional politics of the United States." (Purdy, p. 194) 


Purdy, Chapter 7: Environmental Law in the Anthropocene (228-255), and Chapter 8: What Kind of Democracy (256-288). You can skip 271-281 if you are not interested in humanist vs. post-humanist debates (e.g., animal rights)


## Week 8: Ecofeminist Critique

> Care work is low-emissions, improving lives without material production and consumption --> reproducitve labor pink collar jobs are green. Ecosystems do uncompensated reproductive work too. 

> "Capitalism depends on the socially reproductive labor of the household, and by calling that work an act of love, makes it free...As with Wages for Housework, in which the concrete demand for payment acted as a provocative starting point, the demand for payment for work done to and by ecosystems was originally meant as an unsettling metaphor." (Battistoni, *Alive in the Sunshine*)

- What is the ecofeminist critique? Specifically, what is the argument about reproductive work? What are the implications of this argument for climate policy? 
- In "A Green New Deal for Care," what does Battistoni mean when she says that "pink-collar jobs are green jobs?" 
- In "Alive in the Sunshine," Battistoni presents two ways of seeing the movement for Payment for Ecosystem Services. What are their ideological roots? What are the implications of each for climate policy? 


Policy implications of valuing care work:

> People of color [raised] social justice concerns such as self-determination, sovereignty, human rights, social inequality, loss of land base, limited access to natural resources, and disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards and linked them with traditional working-class environmental concerns such as worker rights and worker health and safety to develop an environmental justice agenda.

   - What are some of the different ways environmental justice is defined? 
- Where did these ideas come from? 
- How are policies addressing environmental justice consistent or inconsistent with different definitions? 
- How might past environmental justice activism be similar to or different from future conflicts in the Anthropocene? 


## Week 11:  Indigenous Critique

  - Reducing harm/injustices to indigenous peoples
  - Indigenous participation/consent
  - Indigenous leadership
  - Self-governance
  
Whyte mainly discusses decisions affecting Indigenous lands, while Tunks focuses on Indigenous voice in settler policy processes (including international policymaking).
