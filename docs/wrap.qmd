## 2: Policy 

> "The hope is that the [Inflation Reduction Act's] bundle of subsidies, tax breaks, infrastructure investment, and market protectionism will unite green-tech boosters with big capital, organized labor, and the beneficiaries of the growth-to-come. If this coalition-building is successful, more green-industrial policy will ensue...Climate is reshaping the terrain on which we will be fighting in the years to come." (Battistoni and Mann)

## 3: Politics 

...in the Anthropocene


World Views:

- What is the "Anthropocene challenge" as described by Purdy? 
- What does Purdy mean by politics and anti-politics? What are some examples? 

> "In a purblindness that has marked all of human history before today, nature has been the thing without politics, the home of the principles that come before politics, whether those are the divine right of kings or the equality of all persons." (Purdy, p. 21)

[Purdy, Prologue and Introduction (1-50)]()

- What does Buck mean by the "constructive ambiguity" of net zero? 
- Purdy discusses several forms of environmental imagination/ideology that shaped U.S. environmental policy and the "terrain" on which policy debates unfold. What kind of political terrain does net zero create?

## 4: God and Nature 

The religious, colonial, and mystic foundations of Western environmental law and politics: 


> "The Settlers of the nineteenth-century frontier, clearing and sowing a continental garden, took to heart John Locke's insistence that  "God wants us to do something" and that nature revealed the intended tasks...And for the Romantics who created the Sierra Club, nature's beauty was evidence that awe and admiration, not just usefulness, were parts of the human purpose. God wanted us not just to do something, but also to stand there---and look." (Purdy, p. 199)

## 5: Utilitarianism and Technology 

> "For the conservationists of the Progressive era, managing nature required a combination of civic spirit and administrative expertise." (Purdy, p. 199) 

- How does utilitarian environmentalism differ from other kinds of environmentalism? On what assumptions do utilitarianism and managerialism rest? Under what circumstances are these assumptions more reasonable or less reasonable, in your opinion? 
- What kinds of politics do different technologies create? Who do they empower and disempower? What kinds of policy fights do they inspire?

## 6: Justice  

> People of color [raised] social justice concerns such as self-determination, sovereignty, human rights, social inequality, loss of land base, limited access to natural resources, and disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards and linked them with traditional working-class environmental concerns such as worker rights and worker health and safety to develop an environmental justice agenda. (Taylor, p. 1)

<!--
- What are some of the different ways environmental justice is defined? 
- Where did these ideas come from? 
- How are policies addressing environmental justice consistent or inconsistent with different definitions? 
- How might past environmental justice activism be similar to different to future conflicts in the Anthropocene?

## 7: Ecological Critique  

> "The Wilderness Society is, philosophically, a disclaimer of the biotic arrogance of *homo americanus*." (Leopold, cited in Purdy, p. 192)

> "It is a curious feature of environmental politics...that its rhetorical fidelity to the past can trick an observer into overlooking how innovative it is...In this respect, environmental politics resembles many religious traditions and the constitutional politics of the United States." (Purdy, p. 194)

## 8:  Feminist Critiques   

Battistoni asks if it is possible to increase people's quality of life while decreasing our impact on the environment (i.e., producing and consuming less material stuff). She finds answers in the feminist concept of carework. Her argument has many clear policy implications. 

- What is the ecofeminist critique? Specifically, what is the argument about reproductive work? What are the implications of this argument for climate policy? 
- In "A Green New Deal for Care," what does Battistoni mean when she says that "pink-collar jobs are green jobs?" 
- In "Alive in the Sunshine," Battistoni presents two ways of seeing the movement for Payment for Ecosystem Services. What are their ideological roots? What are the implications of each for climate policy? 

> "Capitalism depends on the socially reproductive labor of the household, and by calling that work an act of love, makes it free...As with Wages for Housework, in which the concrete demand for payment acted as a provocative starting point, the demand for payment for work done to and by ecosystems was originally meant as an unsettling metaphor." (Battistoni, *Alive in the Sunshine*)

Policy implications of valuing care work:

##  9: Political Economy 

Incumbent industries as a force explaining action and inaction. 

- Why are groups effective at shaping policy? 
- Which industries will lose from which climate policies? Could they pivot?
<!--- Identify examples of “odd bed-fellows”--> 
- What industries have most effectively obstructed policy? How do they work with/against political actors?

## 10: Indigenous Critique  

- What is the indigenous critique? 
  - In the context of renewable energy siting? 
  - In the context of adaptation?
  - In the context of greenhouse gas emissions? 
- Whyte mainly discusses decisions affecting Indigenous lands, while Tunks focuses on Indigenous voices in settler policy processes (including international policymaking). What is the main argument for these two situations? 
- "Indigenous lands" are contested. Settler governments often ignored the provisions of treaties, and many treaties were made under threat of violence. 
  - What are the implications of expanding or shrinking Indigenous governance for addressing climate change? 
  - Conversely, what are the implications of various climate policies for indigenous governance?
