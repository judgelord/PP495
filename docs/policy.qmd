# Jan. 20, 2025 E.O.s^[Note: Executive Orders are generally not legally-binding policy, but rather orders to Executive Branch officials with policymaking authority spelled out in laws passed by Congress. Federal courts may or may not agree that these officials have the statutory or constitutional authority to do some of these things. E.O.s tend to be broad statements of policy wrapped in rhetorical flourish. Courts don't generally intervene until the details are worked out and specific effects are clear. These slides aim to summarize their intended effects in plain language.] {background-opacity="0.15" background-image="https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/5181737412928/2025/1/ba7cfd24d739668d1a4ab54268a90a04/President-Trump-signs-executive-orders-before-inaugural-crowd-at-Capital-One-Arena.jpg"}

## TL;DR 2025 E.O.s

- Big governmental support for oil, gas, and mining, including:
    - using the military to aid transport and refining
    - price supports and subsidies, including for private pipelines
    - taking private property (e.g., for pipelines)
- Ban offshore wind and redefine wind & solar as not "energy"
- End support for water, fuel, or energy efficiency
- Expedite pollution permits and health/safety/cost review^[Directing legal compliance questions to courts (but also reducing judicial oversight?)]
- Expand oil, gas, and mining on public lands
- Rescind requirements to disclose climate risks
- End international cooperation on climate change

## ["Energy Emergency" E.O.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) {background-opacity="0.3" background-image="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7943967a784f994f95931170ff2923f74c7e0899/c=0-139-2000-1269&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/08/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636056598017637651-AP-California-Wildfires.14.jpg"}

To promote oil, gas, biofuels, nuclear, and mining,^[More specifically, “energy” is defined as "crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals"] government agencies should:

Sec. 2. Consider using eminent domain & the Defense Production Act to commandeer private lands and companies^[The Brennan Center has a great summary of [Emergency Powers](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/guide-emergency-powers-and-their-use). Interestingly, this Energy Emergency E.O. does not mention that a Governor of a State may petition the President to suspend any part of a Clean Air Act implementation plan or any requirement under Section 110(f) (42 U.S.C. § 7651j), which Carter granted to fossil fuel power plants during [regional energy emergencies in the 1970s](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268653/energy-emergency-trump-oil-evs).]

Sec. 3-6. Exempt projects from normal health/safety/cost review

- Emergency approvals of public lands leases, pollution permits <!--, production, transportation, refining--> 
- Waive Clean Water Act protections for water quality, wetlands, & coastlines^[As I read it, the emergency powers of the CWA focus emergency *restrictions* to prevent contamination/poisoning, not to permit it.]
- Emergency exemptions from Endangered Species Act restrictions on impacts that cause extinctions
  
Sec. 7. Mobilize the military to build oil and gas infrastructure and aid oil and gas transport and refining 


**Is it following the Project 2025 playbook?** 

> ✘ "**Stopping executive overreach.** Congress should set policy---not Presidents through pen-and-phone executive orders, and not agencies through regulations and guidance. National emergency declarations should expire absent express congressional authorization within 60 days after the date of the declaration." - Project 2025

## [American Energy E.O.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)  {background-opacity="0.3" background-image="https://heartlanddailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LNG-export-terminal.jpg"}

To promote oil, gas, coal, hydro, biofuels, mining, and nuclear industries, government agencies should:

Sec. 2. 

- Direct more federal funds to 
  - offshore oil and gas
  - mining 
- Use no federal funds for 
  - energy efficiency 
  - water efficiency
  - fuel efficiency 
  - electrification, especially not anything related to EVs^[By “electric vehicle (EV) mandate,” this E.O. means (1) the part of the Clean Air Act that [allows](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7543) California to set its own fuel economy standards for cars and trucks (also being attacked in the [courts](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-california-epa-waiver-vehicle-emissions-standards/) ), and (2) IRA subsidies for EVs and other technologies that effectively make EVs cheaper and thus "other types of vehicles affordable." More from NPR [here](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5272749/donald-trump-ev-electric-vehicles-subsidies-auto-industry)]
- Not consider international effects in policymaking

Sec. 3-4. Deregulate oil, gas, coal, hydro, biofuels, mining, and nuclear industries

Sec. 5. Eliminate or expedite environmental review and permitting

- Replace all binding rules implementing the National Environmental Policy Act with nonbinding guidance.^[Environmental Impact Statements will still be required by NEPA (a statute), but I don't see anything in the [NEPA text](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/NEPA%20reg%20amend%2006-2023.pdf) requiring any agency to write binding rules governing EIS.] (NEPA compliance will thus be more often decided by courts.) 
- Reduce judicial review of legal compliance (e.g., NEPA)^[What courts can review is generally up to Congress and the courts (or so say the courts at least). I'm curious if there is a policy or legal argument here.]
- Draft recommendations to Congress on pipeline permitting and construction


Sec. 6. Change cost-benefit analysis 

  - Exclude the [social costs of pollution](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/trump-aims-to-end-carbon-metric-that-puts-price-on-climate-harms)
  - Exclude [co-benefits](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901115301064) of reducing pollution 
  - Exclude [international effects](https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/internationalizing-regulatory-review-by-elena-chachko/)
  - Use higher discount rates (further down-weighting costs and benefits for future generations)
  
Sec. 7. Pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.^[On Jan 21, OMB [clarified](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/omb-memo-m-25-11/) that this only applies to funds supporting programs, projects, or activities that may be implicated by the policy established in Section 2"]

- Especially no money for electric vehicle charging stations

Sec. 8. Approve gas export projects

- Skip NEPA review if possible

Sec. 9. Help companies do more mining on public lands.

- More government funds to locate minerals for companies to mine
- More government funds for mining projects
- Increase National Defense Stockpile of minerals to increase demand and provide supply when there is scarcity in the market

> "**Strategic National Stockpile.** The President should invoke the Defense Production Act, which is a form of temporary takeover of private enterprises, only in the gravest circumstances...The SNS should clarify its mission as supplier of last resort to the federal government, state governments, or first responders."  - Project 2025" 


## Big Beautiful Bill repeals much of IRA 

- [Rescinds $60 million in unspent funds at NOAA for atmospheric, climate, and weather research](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/13/climate/floods-trump-cuts-disaster-preparedness-fema.html)
- Republicans Senators successfully pushed for slightly slower tax credit phaseouts to limit the disruption to industry
    -  But an [E.O.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/climate/trump-renewable-energy-solar.html) instructed the Treasury Department to limit the ability of wind and solar projects to qualify for the fast-disappearing tax credits (legality debated)
- Limits tax credits for projects that source materials or rely on investments from certain countries
-  repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and rescinds all "unobligated" funds.
   - EPA claimed new authority to claw back billions of dollars in funding contracted for renewable energy and efficiency projects, arguing it de-obligated $17 billion in grant funds when it issued termination letters canceling the contracts.
- Pay to play - NEPA review in 180 days


## Big Beautiful Bill upends Farm Bill

Historically, 5-year farm bills are bipartisan legislation with ag and other subsidies for producers in rural areas + SNAP benefits that benefit producers and consumers in rural and urban communities. 

- Cuts $186 billion cut to food assistance (SNAP) from 22.3 million families - [2.4 million families projected to loose food assistance entirely](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/01/snap-benefit-cuts-americans-food-grocery-shopping.html)
   - added work requirements for individuals ages 55 through 64, parents children ages 14 and up and veterans.
- +$65 billion in ag subsidies (mostly crop insurance)
- expanded eligibility to include more kinds of and larger corporations, likely acceleration farmland consolidation (fewer family farms)
- did not cut most conservation programs, rescinds unobligated forestry and conservation funds from the IRA for grants to non-federal forest landowners and $101 million from Urban and Community Forestry Assistance grants. 

Other traditional parts of the Farm Bills were left out. Without further legislation, there will be large cuts to

- National Institute of Food and Agriculture
- Agricultural Research Service
- Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
- Agricultural Marketing Service
- Risk Management Agency
- Farm Service Agency
- Natural Resources Conservation Service
- Food and Nutrition Service


## Rules implementing Energy E.O.

- "Removal of National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Regulations" removes  Trump 1.0-era CEQ rules. 
- Some agencies made new rules (including DOI, DOT, DOE, USDA, FERC). Others switched to "operating procedures" (guidance). 
- All cut public participation and consideration of climate, equity, and cumulative impacts. 
- New categorical exclusions (e.g., based on project cost).

## Further Energy Policy 

- [Despite court orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/trump-unfreezing-federal-grants-judge-ruling.html) and [more court orders](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5216594-appeals-court-keeps-block-on-trumps-sweeping-funding-freeze/), disbursement of funds appropriated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act has been frozen since Feb. 2025. <!--For example, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has posted almost [no new ]( https://www.energy.gov/eere/funding/eere-funding-opportunities)--> 
- [Approval of CA vehicle emissions rules "recended" with no plan to follow the CA exemption portion of the Clean Air Act](https://www.kqed.org/science/1997300/trump-blocks-californias-ev-rules-state-sues-in-response). The Senate Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office say this is not legal.

## [Alaska's Resouces E.O.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/) {background-opacity="0.15" background-image="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-77DHTEAHfdE/TkXAzD8UDoI/AAAAAAAAASU/f3klXPyJjoo/s1600/alaska.jpg"}

Government agencies should: 

- Expedite permitting and leasing, especially for gas export and pipelines
- Exempt gas export from regulations 
- Open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas extraction
- Replace many 2024 Environmental Impact Statements with 2020 versions
- Remove protections for subsistence resources
- Deny the request for an Indigenous sacred site in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
- Permit more hunting and fishing on federal lands
- Support companies operating the failing Trans-Alaska Pipeline
- Build more roads in National Forests 

## [Wind Projects E.0.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/) {background-opacity="0.15" background-image="https://forefrontaalborg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_366215509-2048x1069.jpg"}

Government agencies should: 

- Temporarily (?) ban new offshore wind ("until this Presidential Memorandum is revoked.")^[Biden similarly [succeeded](https://apnews.com/article/biden-louisiana-new-orleans-gulf-of-mexico-b209a922546aefb35595dfe920b63b60) in banning *new* offshore oil and gas] 
  - prevents consideration of any wind energy lease renewal
  - does not apply to oil, gas, minerals
- Review existing permits/leases to identify legal bases for terminating existing wind energy leases
- Impose a moratorium on all activities and rights of Magic Valley Energy granted by the Bureau of Land Management's 2024 approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project
- Require developers to pay for the removal of old windmills

Rescinds nearly all Biden E.O.s^[including mundane things like the order of succession at the Department of Agriculture and outdated things like re-opening schools and offices after the pandemic] 

**Highlights:** Federal agencies should: 
 
- Rescind restrictions on leasing for oil and gas offshore and on public land
- Rescind requirements to disclose climate risks

Climate-Related E.O.s rescinded: 

- Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis).
- Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology).

- anyone supervising such employees
- any other employees an agency director wants included

Directs the Office of Personnel Management to rescind its 2024 rule “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles” and (in clear contradiction of the Administrative Procedure Act) declares that rule "inoperative and without effect."

- *Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County* - (1) more deference in NEPA + (2) NEPA review need not (can't?) consider upstream or downstream effects (e.g., climate change and environmental justice)

whether an agency’s final decision (here, to approve the
railroad) was reasonably explained." 

> "[Indirect effects] may be factually
foreseeable, but that does not mean that those effects are
relevant to the agency’s decisionmaking process"

# Policies Under Consideration 


## The 2026 Proposed Budget 

- eliminates about $882 million in the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, which helped support resources like flood control systems, wildfire prevention, and storm water management upgrades
- [ends collection of greenhouse gas data after 70 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/climate/budget-cuts-climate-observatories.html)
- Proposed budget to close 10 laboratories run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that research the ways a warming planet is changing weather, including [firing Miami teams of “hurricane hunters”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/13/climate/floods-trump-cuts-disaster-preparedness-fema.html)
- The proposed budget would also [end funding for river gauges and cancel the leases for 25 of the roughly 100 water science research facilities that predict floods.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/13/climate/floods-trump-cuts-disaster-preparedness-fema.html)



## [H.R. 3898 - the PERMIT act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3898) {background-opacity="0.15" background-image="https://fox11online.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/center/90/d95c56b1-d7fa-4a0d-b191-f404ab72736a-MILWAUKEEFLOODINGVO.transfer_frame_533.jpeg"}

Allows building on most wetlands without a permit by limiting Clean Water Act protections, judicial review of permits, and state and local governments' ability to protect wetlands. <!--by redefining navigable waters to exclude (1) waste treatment systems, (2) ephemeral features that flow only in direct response to precipitation, (3) prior converted cropland, (4) groundwater, or (5) any other features determined to be excluded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.--> 

- **removes all protections** for groundwater, streams, and wetlands that dry out between rain events, streams and wetlands near farmland, and **any other waters or wetlands determined to be excluded** by the Army Corps
- prohibits states from considering factors other than local water quality (e.g., climate change) in 401 permitting
- shifts EPA's role from public health to minimizing costs to industry 
- limits public comment on and challenges to permits 
- shield polluters from liability 
- removes restrictions on pesticides
- reduces judicial review of permitting by vastly shortening the statute of limitations, limiting standing to file suit, and limiting the 
Court's options for recourse.
Increases procedural barriers to establishing water quality criteria and increases opportunities for litigation.

## National Defense Authorization Act for 2026.

- "Climate resilient" changed to "resilient"
- Little indication that DOD is backing away from transition to electric vehicles and climate adaptation plans
- 2025 Authorization Bill bans DOD from requiring contractors to disclose GHG emissions
