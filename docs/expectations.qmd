# Read carefully for argument

Decide what *you* think about the author's augment

Pose a *discussion* question *about the reading*.

Have answers to the questions posed in the syllabus, even if tentative. It's good to guess. 
There are some questions we will ask of every reading: 

- What is the author's argument? 
- What do you think about it? 
- Does it apply elsewhere? 
- What does it imply for what we should do? 

Come to class ready to answer these questions.
