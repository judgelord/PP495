# üó∫Ô∏è  Objectives

In the past century---the blink of an eye in ecological time---a small portion of humans concentrated in wealthier and more industrialized countries began to radically transform the ecology of our planet at an unprecedented scale.^[OK, sure, cyanobacteria were [similarly tranfromative](https://asm.org/articles/2022/february/the-great-oxidation-event-how-cyanobacteria-change), but that was billions of years ago, and cyanobacteria cannot reflect on their actions. They make oxygen, but neither politics nor policy.] 

This class aims to help you develop your own critique of various policy fights over what to do about our new relationship with our biosphere. 

Experts increasingly see the slow policy response to climate science as having less to do with climate science and technology and more to do with politics. That is, climate change is increasingly seen as a problem for the social sciences to address. Thus, this class is about politics. "Politics" can mean many things, and a core objective of this class is understanding different forms of politics---different ways of having and resolving debates about who our community is and what we will do together about the challenges we face. <!--Climate policy debates reflect well-established political and economic perspectives but also raise new, unique issues. -->

The core readings are mostly drawn from political science, political theory, and law. They are accompanied by op-eds and podcasts from advocates and journalists covering climate policy debates. Both the theories of politics and political arguments cover a wide range of perspectives. We will read a range of critiques based on different visions of good politics---from left to right, religious to utilitarian, populist to technocratic---with the aim of recognizing and critiquing these forms of politics when we see them in the wild. While we will mainly focus on policy debates in the United States, the underlying political struggles can be seen everywhere. 

The assignments for this class are motivated by the observation that politics is fundamentally an organized activity. Thus, the critiques we develop in this class will target organizations. In your opinion, are they choosing the right battles? Are they taking the right positions? Are they framing the issues in the most effective way? Is their theory of change (or resistance to change) realistic?

Critiquing those with whom we severely disagree is easy, but they are also the least likely to listen to you. Thus, the critiques you develop in this class will be aimed at the organizations you see as having the best chance of making a positive difference in the world---specifically, the organizations for whom you hope to work or volunteer. You may not know what your future career looks like; that is fine. Perhaps you will find an organization or cause that inspires you in this class. Or perhaps you have a very clear idea of your future career. In that case, this class will challenge you to think about how organizations in your intended field of work engage in politics and policymaking---and how they might do so differently. It is not a requirement that the organizations you address are activist organizations. Indeed, activist organizations may be the most difficult to critique because they already have a well-developed approach to politics and policy. You may even see yourself working for an organization that is currently strongly opposed to most proposed climate policies; that is fine. For example, if you aim to work at Exxon-Mobil, you might look to Business School scholarship to formulate a critique like [this one](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_put_the_fossil_fuel_industry_into_hospice). 

As practice for developing your skills in both effective writing and constructive criticism, peer critiques of your colleagues' writing are a major part of this class and of your grade.

## Course Philosophy 

In designing this course, I proceed from several premises: 

1. It is worth knowing the **history** of our current policy debates and the **ideas and values** that the rhetoric of these policy debates evokes.

1. It is more interesting to explore **serious proposals** about what to do than people arguing against doing anything. That said, there are lots of ideas about what to do, and many don't agree. I just don't give a ton of time to defenders of the status quo, especially to the extent that they intentionally use obfuscating rhetoric---I don‚Äôt want this class to be a victim of efforts to sow confusion. Thus, I focus on authors with the most earnest, sincere, and uncompromised statements of what to do and why. For example, big business lobbyists and public relations firms significantly shape our current debate, but we ought to take what they say is good for the environment with a huge grain of salt because they are not primarily interested in our relationship with our biosphere; they aim to help their clients make money by spinning what is good for business as good for the environment. 

1. It is more interesting to explore **deeply rooted ideas** and see them in rhetoric than to stay at the level of rhetoric. This class is about politics and policy and only secondarily about rhetoric and communications. I don't want us to limit our thinking to what plays well in current mass media or elite discourse. I want you to develop a position on how you think politics should be reshaped and how we should balance competing values. Then, let that inform your analysis of the rhetoric.

1. **Humans are having a significant impact on the biosphere**. I don‚Äôt have much about climate change [denialism](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oreskes-supran-exxonmobil-20170901-story.html) on the syllabus. Mainstream policy debates have moved passed outright denialism. Even the incumbent industry talking points have moved on from denial and even away from doubt and minimizing. They now acknowledge climate science and cast themselves as helping to address it, sow skepticism that policies they dislike will work, slow policymaking behind the scenes, deflect responsibility, and focus on personal responsibility and other forms of [anti-politics](#purdy.html#anti-politics). The [merchants of doubt](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/merchants-of-doubt-9781608193943/) have [shifted from attacking science to attacking policies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2018.1439353) as too uncertain, too expensive, and unnecessary. 

1. Individual action is good but insufficient; **collective action (and thus politics) is required**. This class is in the public policy school, and I am a political scientist. We are here to learn about the many different kinds of policy and politics proposed to address climate change, not argue about whether policy and politics, in general, are useful for solving problems. 


# üèõÔ∏è Learning Environment

Learning from each other is only possible if we show the respect due to our fellow citizens of this class.

To realize this goal, I expect us to respect our colleagues and cultivate inclusive discussions. This means that we must be careful not to mislead, degrade, interrupt someone who does not speak as much, or enforce hierarchies based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, or ability.

<!--[Best Practices for Navigating the Classroom Environment -

## üìú Ford School and University of Michigan Policies

**Ford School Inclusivity Statement:**
Members of the Ford School community represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community, we ask all members to: 

- share their unique experiences, values, and beliefs
- be open to the views of others
- honor the uniqueness of their colleagues
- appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community
- value one another‚Äôs opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
- keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature
- use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in Ford - classes and across the UM community


Being a constructive member of a diverse community is always a learning process. The University has many resources to help us in this endeavor, including a [glossary of terms]( 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7whjk69ckv3h39r/AAAsKb3tOl4OulF63-mJsHa1a/Glossary%20of%20Terms?dl=0&preview=Clearinghouse+-+Glossary.pdf&subfolder_nav_tracking=1).

**Ford School Public Health Protection Policy.**  In order to participate in any in-person aspects of this course---including meeting with other students to study or work on a team project---you must follow all the public health safety measures and policies put in place by the State of Michigan, Washtenaw County, the University of Michigan, and the Ford School. Up-to-date information on U-M policies can be found on the  [U-M Health Response website](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/).  It is expected that you will protect and enhance the health of everyone in the Ford School community by staying home and following self-isolation guidelines if you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. 

**Student Mental Health and Wellbeing.**  The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students.  We acknowledge that a variety of issues, both those relating to the pandemic and other issues such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, can directly impact students‚Äô academic performance and overall wellbeing. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. 

You may access the Ford School‚Äôs embedded counselor Paige Ziegler (pziegler@umich.edu) and/or counselors and urgent services at [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://caps.umich.edu/) and/or [University Health Service (UHS)](https://www.uhs.umich.edu/mentalhealthsvcs).  Students may also use the Crisis Text Line (text '4UMICH' to 741741) to be connected to a trained crisis volunteer.  You can find additional resources both on and off campus through the [University Health Service](https://uhs.umich.edu/stressresources) and through [CAPS](https://caps.umich.edu/article/um-mental-health-resources).

**Student/Faculty Interaction Best Practices.** We strive to ensure a safe learning environment free from gender-based and sexual harassment, sexual violence, retaliation, and a hostile environment based on discrimination and intimidation. We make the following commitments:  

- To conduct office hours with the door open unless the student requests a closed-door meeting;
- To document meeting times with students so that this record can be reviewed;
- To meet students individually only at university venues;
- To conduct off-campus meetings only at places where alcohol is not served;
- To communicate electronically with students only on university platforms and not on social media, text, or non-university apps.
- For more information on resources for reporting sexual misconduct, please see [the faculty senate best practices for faculty interactions](https://facultysenate.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-PRACTICES-FOR-FACULTY-_-STUDENT-INTERACTIONS.pdf) and [U-M's page on Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct](https://sexualmisconduct.umich.edu/).


**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:**  
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University of Michigan recognizes disability as an integral part of diversity and is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment for students with disabilities. Students who are experiencing a disability-related barrier should visit the Services for Students with Disabilities website. They can be reached at 734-763-3000 or ssdoffice@umich.edu. For students who are connected with SSD, accommodation requests can be made in Accommodate. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your SSD Coordinator or visit SSD‚Äôs Current Student webpage. SSD considers aspects of the course design, course learning objects, and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SSD, instructors, and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

::: {.callout-important}
**If you require accommodations from SSD, please start that process quickly because it takes time. **
:::

**Academic Integrity:**  The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one‚Äôs own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School's policy of academic integrity can be found in the [MPP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuq2jfmbpflm4f2/FINAL%202023%20Masters%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0),  [BA](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhllbd4vpfr439r/FINAL%202023%20BA%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0), and [Ph.D. Program](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06x1tzt1e32pjjw/FINAL%202023%20PHD%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0) handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at [U-M's academic-policies page]( http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11#112).



**Use of Technology:**  Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor.  If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first have informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and, in some cases, your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.

Please review additional information and policies regarding [academic expectations and resources](https://intranet.fordschool.umich.edu/academic-expectations) at the Ford School of Public Policy.

See the end of the syllabus for information about our commitment to best practices of instructor/student interactions. 


## üìµ Technology in Class

No screens in class (except as an accommodation via the U.M. Services for Students with Disabilities office). Research shows that they inhibit learning and distract your colleagues. Out of respect to the instructor and your fellow students, put your phone away for the duration of class. 

You will not receive participation points for classes where you are on a screen during class time without permission. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools That Generate Text

You learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the crafts of constructive critique and persuasive writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft arguments and recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking a [SALAMI](https://blog.quintarelli.it/2019/11/lets-forget-the-term-ai-lets-call-them-systematic-approaches-to-learning-algorithms-and-machine-inferences-salami/). I expect the same. 

Text extruded by large language models (LLMs) is, by construction, derivative of patterns of words already linked together on the internet. In some sense, everything we do is derivative of our experiences, but the generative process is very different for thinking subjects (you) than for a pre-trained language model. Language models are [excellent at helping us conform to grammar conventions^[I recommend <https://app.grammarly.com/>] but incapable of producing original critiques. If they produce something that sounds insightful, it is only because we are able to assign meaning to the strings of words they extrude. (It also probably sounds right because it resembles things already written by a human on the internet.) Language models have no sense of meaning and cannot judge the consistency, coherence, or logic of an argument.  I expect the critiques you produce to be yours and for you to stand by them as intellectual projects. No LLM can help you justify your thought process and reasoning. LLMs have no thought process and do not reason. Language is always in flux, but I see "reasoning" and "intelligence" are misnomers when applied to LLMs. 

Beyond grammar conventions, I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of persuasive writing or for learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich white men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts. Uncritically using LLMs trained on biased source material risks reproducing those biases.

Good policy and political strategy rest on good evidence. LLMs can fabricate evidence. Even when the sources are real, unless it is an exact quote, LLMs cannot guarantee a reasonable link between a claim and a source (LLMs don't reason), only a statistically probable word order. Extruded text is often sensible, but there is no guarantee. Be careful. Work submitted with <mark>fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0</mark> for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make work worse than worthless. <!--The key recommendation of experts studying how students can effectively use LLMs is to craft a solid bibliography first and constrain generative tools to those sources. You will still have to do significant work to make sure that sources are used and cited appropriately, but this is much easier than finding real evidence to replace fake evidence and *then* making sure it is used and cited correctly.-->  
Thus, <mark>**references must be hyperlinked**</mark> whenever possible; I will check to make sure sources of evidence are used appropriately. 

If you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used them for, what they got right, and what they got wrong. 

I reserve the right to discuss your papers in length with you if I have concerns that technological crutches are hindering your learning.

# ü™∂ Assignments 

Credit hours will be earned by attending two classes of $1.3\bar{3}$ hours each, reading and preparing written work outside of class for 6 to 9 hours per week, and a series of incremental assignments building to a highly-polished op-ed style critique of an organization's approach to climate policy. A key part of the process will be critiquing the writing of others. Detailed instructions for each assignment are available in the [assignment guide](assignments). 


Most weeks, the assignments are incremental steps to your final op-ed. 

In week 6, you will write a reflection on how you have experienced climate politics. This should mirror Mary Anna√Øse Heglar's essay, Home is Always Worth It, but can be significantly shorter (200-800 words).

In week 12, you will write a reflection on how you carry with you different world views/ways of seeing nature/forms of environmental imagination/paradigms and how they shape your thinking. This should mirror Purdy's self-reflection in the introduction of *After Nature* by including the four world views we read about, but it may also include others (including, perhaps, some of the new emerging visions discussed in Chapter 7) (200-800 words).

## Late Submissions

Because nearly all assignments are either revised versions of previous submissions that someone else must review on a tight timeline or peer reviews that your peers depend on in order to make revisions on a tight timeline, late work is not an option. 

- If you do not submit a revised version of your op-ed(s) on time, I will resubmit your previous version for review on your behalf. This will make sure you still get feedback on your work. If you submit by the end of the week, I will award partial points, but your reviewer is not expected to wait for the revised version to submit their review. 
- Late reviews are unfair to your classmates. If you do not submit a peer review on time, I will submit a review on your behalf, and you will not receive points for that review. 

Under extenuating circumstances, I will attempt to work out an alternative review cycle. This is much easier if I am the one reviewing a draft than if it is a draft submitted for peer review.


## Participation - 22% (24 classes X 1% per class - 2 pass days) 

- Discussion posts about at least one of the readings are due by <mark> 7 p.m. on Canvas Mondays and Wednesdays</mark> weeks 2-14. Late posts are not counted. Posts should be 100-200 words and include a brief summary of <mark> (1) Your understanding of the author's main argument, (2) What you think about that argument, AND (3) A question *about the reading(s)* that merits further discussion.</mark>  <!--TODO See my [guide for crafting a good discussion question]().-->

Questions should model good intellectual practice; that is, not just a one-sentence question, but a few sentences providing some important framing or context. This could include, for example, an explanation of why the question is important (the stakes), an elaboration on the nuances of the question, etc. Reference to specific language in the text(s) is encouraged, and quotes are welcome. For material on the syllabus, simply cite the author and page; for materials beyond the syllabus, please include a full reference. Be sure to reflect on the bulk of the readings for the day; i.e., demonstrate that you‚Äôve read all of the assigned material.

Questions should represent two specific types according to the following classification (identify the types in your post):

- Clarification/Comprehension (e.g., What does X mean?)
- Analytical/Interpretive (e.g., How does X evidence relate to Y point?)
- Synthetic/Evaluative (e.g., Are you convinced by the author‚Äôs argument that X? ) If you choose this question, be sure to say why the argument is provocative or has important implications. If you think a statement is obviously correct or trivial, then it is not worth discussing whether we agree with it.
- Connective/Comparative (e.g., How does X‚Äôs argument compare to Y‚Äôs we read last week?) If you choose this question, point us in the direction of some key similarities or differences. 
- Provocative/Argumentative (e.g., Doesn‚Äôt evidence X undermine author‚Äôs point Y?!)
- Applied/Extended (e.g., Does X point help explain current problem Y?) If you choose this question, be sure to indicate why or how the comparison is relevant. I.e., don‚Äôt use this as a mindless invitation to extend an analysis across policy problems.

### Make-up policy 

You get two days to take a pass on posting a discussion question and/or participating in class. Even if you are taking a pass on participation, I hope you will still come to class. If you are taking a pass and don't want me to call you into the conversation, just let me know ahead of time.

Pass days will initially appear as "0" on Canvas, but I will adjust participation points when I calculate your final scores in Canvas. 

Beyond your two pass days, I allow you to make up two additional days:

- If you know that you will miss class, write a `1-page reflection` on the readings and share it with the class **with your discussion post.**
- If you unexpectedly miss class, post a `1-page reflection on the readings **AND schedule a time to discuss the readings with me**` (ideally, during office hours)

Beyond four missed classes (two passes, two make-ups), I  only allow make-ups in very extenuating circumstances. Participation is a core part of this class, and the entire class is deprived of your perspective when you are not with us.

# üìñ Reading by Week


> Each week's required readings are indented and marked with a grey sidebar. I also often note "resources" or "further readings" with bullets---these are not required readings.


üéß Most weeks include audio content, either in addition to or as an alternative to required reading. Pay attention to the minutes assigned. Some podcasts keep going, and you don't need to keep listening.



I have intentionally put a wide range of perspectives on the syllabus, sometimes in conversation (see weeks on justice, markets, nationalism, and movements).

There are some questions we will ask of every reading: 

- What is the author's argument? 
- What do you think about it? 
- Does it apply elsewhere? 
- What does it imply for what we should do? 

Come to class ready to answer these questions. 

If you hit a paywall on a link from the syllabus:

1. Look to see if it says `(Canvas->Perusall)` next to it. These readings should be on Perusall <!-- in the "files/readings" folder on Canvas.--> If they are not, please let me know ASAP.  
2. Make sure that you are logged in to get library access to journals. You can also search for the journal on the library website.   
3. If 1 & 2 don't work, please let me know ASAP so that I can make sure you all have access. Sometimes, paywalls don't pop up for me because of some cached credentials, and I don't realize that the content is paywalled. You should not pay for any of the online content for this course. 
There are many "further" readings, and some required readings (especially the longer academic articles) say "skim." Here is advice on [how to read political science from Amelia Hoover Green](https://www.ameliahoovergreen.com/uploads/9/3/0/9/93091546/howtoread.pdf) and [how to skim from Jessica Calarco](https://www.jessicacalarco.com/tips-tricks/2018/9/2/beyond-the-abstract-reading-for-meaning-in-academia).




## Week 1: Hope

...in an unequal and chaotic world.

### Tuesday: Introductions and Syllabus Review 


> Please read <mark> the entire syllabus</mark> before class---this is your chance to ask questions about the assignments and readings.

### Tuesday: in-class [best-practices exercise](best-practices.html)

- What are you hoping to get out of this semester?
- What aspects of the discussion environment will help achieve these goals? 
- What has been your personal experience with climate change discourse and policy? What motivates you to do something? What makes you not want to get involved?

## Week 2: Policy 

> "The hope is that the [Inflation Reduction Act's] bundle of subsidies, tax breaks, infrastructure investment, and market protectionism will unite green-tech boosters with big capital, organized labor, and the beneficiaries of the growth to come. If this coalition-building is successful, more green-industrial policy will ensue...Climate is reshaping the terrain on which we will be fighting in the years to come." (Battistoni and Mann)

### Tuesday: The State of U.S. Climate Policy: 

This week, we are hearing from fairly mainstream policy people who work in similar circles (except for Battistoni and Mann's critique from the labor left). You should not take agreement among them as evidence that there is broad political agreement on all of these things; it is just a function of what I assigned, which is a function of who happens to be in the room where climate policy is being made today. In future weeks, we will read a broader range of perspectives, but I think we need to start here to understand where we are today before we dive deeper into how we got here in weeks 3-7 and where we might go from here in weeks 8-14.

## Week 3: The Anthropocene Challenge


> "In a purblindness that has marked all of human history before today, nature has been the thing without politics, the home of the principles that come before politics, whether those are the divine right of kings or the equality of all persons." (Purdy, p. 21)

### Tuesday: In-class peer workshop of draft op-ed headlines for Week 3 assignment.


### Thursday: World Views:

## Week 4: God and Nature

The religious, colonial, and mystic foundations of Western environmental law and politics: 


> "The Settlers of the nineteenth-century frontier, clearing and sowing a continental garden, took to heart John Locke's insistence that 'God wants us to do something' and that nature revealed the intended tasks...And for the Romantics who created the Sierra Club, nature's beauty was evidence that awe and admiration, not just usefulness, were parts of the human purpose. God wanted us not just to do something, but also to stand there---and look." (Purdy, p. 199)

## Week 8: Ecofeminist Critique

### Tuesday: Fall Break

### Thursday: Ecofeminist Critique

Battistoni asks if it is possible to increase people's quality of life while decreasing our impact on the environment (i.e., producing and consuming less material stuff). She finds answers in the feminist concept of care work. Her argument has many clear policy implications. 

> "Capitalism depends on the socially reproductive labor of the household, and by calling that work an act of love, makes it free...As with Wages for Housework, in which the concrete demand for payment acted as a provocative starting point, the demand for payment for work done to and by ecosystems was originally meant as an unsettling metaphor." (Battistoni, *Alive in the Sunshine*)

- What is the ecofeminist critique? Specifically, what is the argument about reproductive work? What are the implications of this argument for climate policy? 
- In "A Green New Deal for Care," what does Battistoni mean when she says that "pink-collar jobs are green jobs?" 
- In "Alive in the Sunshine," Battistoni presents two ways of seeing the movement for Payment for Ecosystem Services. What are their ideological roots? What are the implications of each for climate policy?

(Taylor, p. 1)

- What are some of the different ways environmental justice is defined? 
- Where did these ideas come from? 
- How are policies addressing environmental justice consistent or inconsistent with different definitions?

## Week 11:  Indigenous Critique

- What is the indigenous critique? 
  - In the context of renewable energy siting? 
  - In the context of adaptation?
  - In the context of greenhouse gas emissions? 
  
- How does Whyte distinguish:
  - Reducing harm/injustices to indigenous peoples
  - Indigenous participation/consent
  - Indigenous leadership
  - Self-governance
  
- Whyte mainly discusses decisions affecting Indigenous lands, while Tunks focuses on Indigenous voice in settler policy processes (including international policymaking). What is the main argument for these two situations? 
<!--
- "Indigenous lands" are contested. Settler governments often ignore provisions of treaties, and many treaties were made under threat of violence. -->
 - What are the implications of expanding or shrinking Indigenous governance for addressing climate change? 
 - Conversely, what are the implications of various climate policies for indigenous governance?

The Southern Poverty Law Center designates [FAIR as a Hate Group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/federation-american-immigration-reform) and [Hardin as an Extremist White Nationalist](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/garrett-hardin). While all assigned readings have a perspective, these views most starkly contrast the University of Michigan's stated [goals](https://culturejourney.umich.edu/values/) and [policies](https://spg.umich.edu/policy/201.35). And yet, these views are increasingly prominent in climate policy discourse, so it is important to understand them.


Also note that some factual claims in *U.S. Immigration and the Environment* contradict data from other sources like the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58347#_idTextAnchor003) and the [PEW research center](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/20/facts-on-u-s-immigrants/?tabId=tab-eb7dc167-cc10-458b-9b05-36485deec7df).

<!--Learning Objectives
-Understand the basic role of local governments in planning and development. 
- Understand how planners control individuals of individual parcels of land but must constantly deal with broader economic and social forces at work in an urban area.
-Understand different planning approaches:  top-down and bottom-up planning, consensus planning, and centralized and fragmenting budgeting.
-Understand the planning paradox:  making decisions attuned to the interests of existing stakeholders and planning to change the urban area to adapt to changing economic, environmental, and social forces.
-Understand how climate change affects different cities‚Äô environments and economies and, thus, changes the agendas of city governments.
-Understand the linkages between cities and surrounding suburban and rural areas.   How do cities affect the economies of surrounding areas?  How do cities depend on these surrounding areas? How do these surrounding areas (especially suburbs) rely on cities? How do land use changes in surrounding areas lead to changes in cities?  

Adaptation planning 
Learning Objectives
-Explain the meaning of vulnerability, risk, and resilience planning, and provide examples
-Differentiate between mitigation and adaptation, and how they can relate to each other
-Identify technologies that could help with adaptation and the challenges behind their adaptation.

### Thursday: Wrap-up

- How has your understanding of the politics of policymaking changed since the start of the semester?
- Which reading stands out to us most and why?
- What connections do you see between your op-eds and the readings?


## Extra 

Many topics did not make it onto this syllabus. My recommendations for readings on other climate policy topics are [here](reading). 

## Ammendments 

Because many topics we cover are subjects of ongoing discussion, I may make occasional changes to the course readings over the semester. I will notify you of any substantive changes. The full revision history is [on github](https://github.com/judgelord/PP495/commits/main/docs/syllabus.html).

## More Information on Student Instructor Best Practices

We will conduct office hours with my door open unless you request otherwise.

Students who wish to have confidential conversations with me may schedule a private meeting via Zoom or may ask to have a closed-door meeting. But this closed-door meeting must be made on your request in writing, even on the spot. I will never suggest a closed-door meeting myself because of the power dynamic.

We will document all pre-scheduled meetings between the instructor and the student via Google Calendar (or other software) and/or university email.

Students who email to request an office hour appointment should expect to receive an email confirmation or a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation from me, or, upon my email confirmation and request, may send me a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation for this meeting. The purpose is to provide a permanent record of the meeting and to ensure that all class activities are documented and transparent. Students who choose to drop by for informal meetings are welcome to do so, but there will be no documentation provided. (See above for open-door policy.)

We will choose meeting locations and conduct meetings with student and instructor safety in mind.

We will ensure that all individual meetings between the instructor/student will take place at university venues.

We will ensure that all off-campus meetings, trips, or events engage with the course material.

Off-campus meetings will not involve alcohol or take place at locations that serve alcohol. If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).

We, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.

There will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.
