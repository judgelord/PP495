<section id="objectives" class="level1">
<h1>🗺️ Objectives</h1>
<p>In the past century—the blink of an eye in ecological time—a small portion of humans concentrated in wealthier and more industrialized countries began to radically transform the ecology of our planet at an unprecedented scale.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This class aims to help you develop your own critique of various policy fights over what to do about our new relationship with our biosphere.</p>
<p>Experts increasingly see the slow policy response to climate science as having less to do with climate science and more to do with politics. That is, climate change is increasingly seen as a problem for the social sciences to address. Thus, this class is about politics. “Politics” can mean many things, and a core objective of this class is understanding different forms of politics—different ways of having and resolving debates about who our community is and what we will do together about the challenges we face. <!--Climate policy debates reflect well-established political and economic perspectives but also raise new, unique issues. --></p>
<p>The core readings are mostly drawn from political science, political theory, and law. They are accompanied by op-eds and podcasts from advocates and journalists covering climate policy debates. Both the theories of politics and political arguments cover a wide range of perspectives. We will read a range of critiques based on different visions of good politics—from left to right, religious to utilitarian, populist to technocratic—with the aim of recognizing and critiquing these forms of politics when we see them in the wild. While we will mainly focus on policy debates in the United States, the underlying political struggles can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>The assignments for this class are motivated by the observation that politics is fundamentally an organized activity. Thus, the critiques we develop in this class will target organizations. In your opinion, are they choosing the right battles? Are they taking the right positions? Are they framing the issues in the most effective way? Is their theory of change (or resistance to change) realistic?</p>
<p>It is easy to critique those with whom we severely disagree, but they are also the least likely to listen to you. Thus, the critiques you develop in this class will be aimed at the organizations you see as having the best chance of making a positive difference in the world—specifically, the organizations for whom you hope to work. You may have no idea what your future career looks like; that is fine. Perhaps you will find an organization or cause that inspires you in this class. Or perhaps you have a very clear idea of your future career. In that case, this class will challenge you to think about how organizations in your intended field of work engage in politics and policymaking—and how they might do so differently. It is not a requirement that the organizations you address are activist organizations. Indeed, activist organizations may be the most difficult to critique because they already have a well-developed approach to politics and policy. You may even see yourself working for an organization that is currently strongly opposed to most proposed climate policies; that is fine. For example, if you aim to work at Exxon-Mobil, you might look to Business School scholarship to formulate a critique like <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_put_the_fossil_fuel_industry_into_hospice">this one</a>.</p>
<p>As practice for developing your skills in both effective writing and constructive criticism, peer critiques of your colleagues’ writing are a major part of this class and 10% of your grade.</p>

<section id="learning-environment" class="level1">
<h1>🏛️ Learning Environment</h1>
<p>Learning from each other is only possible if we show the respect due to our fellow citizens of this class.</p>
<p>To realize this goal, I expect us to respect our colleagues and cultivate inclusive discussions. This means that we must be careful not to mislead, degrade, interrupt someone who does not speak as much, or enforce hierarchies based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, or ability.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ford-school-and-university-of-michigan-policies">📜 Ford School and University of Michigan Policies</h2>
<p><strong>Ford School Inclusivity Statement:</strong> Members of the Ford School community represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community, we ask all members to:</p>
<ul>
<li>share their unique experiences, values, and beliefs</li>
<li>be open to the views of others</li>
<li>honor the uniqueness of their colleagues</li>
<li>appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community</li>
<li>value one another’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner</li>
<li>keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature</li>
<li>use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in Ford - classes and across the UM community</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a constructive member of a diverse community is always a learning process. The University has many resources to help us in this endeavor, including a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7whjk69ckv3h39r/AAAsKb3tOl4OulF63-mJsHa1a/Glossary%20of%20Terms?dl=0&amp;preview=Clearinghouse+-+Glossary.pdf&amp;subfolder_nav_tracking=1">glossary of terms</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ford School Public Health Protection Policy.</strong> In order to participate in any in-person aspects of this course—including meeting with other students to study or work on a team project—you must follow all the public health safety measures and policies put in place by the State of Michigan, Washtenaw County, the University of Michigan, and the Ford School. Up-to-date information on U-M policies can be found on the <a href="https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/">U-M Health Response website</a>. It is expected that you will protect and enhance the health of everyone in the Ford School community by staying home and following self-isolation guidelines if you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Student Mental Health and Wellbeing.</strong> The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. We acknowledge that a variety of issues, both those relating to the pandemic and other issues such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, can directly impact students’ academic performance and overall wellbeing. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.</p>
<p>You may access the Ford School’s embedded counselor Paige Ziegler (pziegler@umich.edu) and/or counselors and urgent services at <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a> and/or <a href="https://www.uhs.umich.edu/mentalhealthsvcs">University Health Service (UHS)</a>. Students may also use the Crisis Text Line (text ‘4UMICH’ to 741741) to be connected to a trained crisis volunteer. You can find additional resources both on and off campus through the <a href="https://uhs.umich.edu/stressresources">University Health Service</a> and through <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/um-mental-health-resources">CAPS</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Student/Faculty Interaction Best Practices.</strong> We strive to ensure a safe learning environment free from gender-based and sexual harassment, sexual violence, retaliation, and a hostile environment based on discrimination and intimidation. We make the following commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li>To conduct office hours with the door open unless the student requests a closed-door meeting;</li>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuq2jfmbpflm4f2/FINAL%202023%20Masters%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">MPP</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhllbd4vpfr439r/FINAL%202023%20BA%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">BA</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/06x1tzt1e32pjjw/FINAL%202023%20PHD%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">Ph.D.&nbsp;Program</a> handbooks.

<p><strong>Use of Technology:</strong> Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first have informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and, in some cases, your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.</p>

<section id="tools-that-generate-text" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tools-that-generate-text">🛠️ Tools That Generate Text</h2>
<p>You learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the crafts of constructive critique and persuasive writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft arguments and recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking a <a href="https://blog.quintarelli.it/2019/11/lets-forget-the-term-ai-lets-call-them-systematic-approaches-to-learning-algorithms-and-machine-inferences-salami/">SALAMI</a>. I expect the same.</p>
<p>Text extruded by large language models (LLMs) is, by construction, derivative of patterns of words already linked together on the internet. In some sense, everything we do is derivative of our experiences, but the generative process is very different for thinking subjects (you) than for a pre-trained language model. Language models are incapable of producing original critiques. If they produce something that sounds insightful, it is only because we are able to assign meaning to the strings of words they extrude. (It also probably sounds right because it resembles things already written by a human on the internet.) Language models have no sense of meaning and cannot judge the consistency, coherence, or logic of an argument. I expect the critiques you produce to be yours and for you to stand by them as intellectual projects. No LLM can help you justify your thought process and reasoning. LLMs have no thought process and do not reason.</p>
<p>I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of persuasive writing or learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich White men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts. Uncritically using LLMs trained on biased source material risks reproducing those biases.</p>
<p>Good policy and political strategy rests on good evidence. Many LLMs fabricate evidence. Work submitted with <mark>fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0</mark> for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make work worse than worthless. <!--The key recommendation of experts studying how students can effectively use LLMs is to craft a solid bibliography first and constrain generative tools to those sources. You will still have to do significant work to make sure that sources are used and cited appropriately, but this is much easier than finding real evidence to replace fake evidence and *then* making sure it is used and cited correctly.--> Thus, <mark><strong>references must be hyperlinked</strong></mark> whenever possible; I will be checking to make sure sources of evidence are used appropriately.</p>
<p>If you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used them for, what they got right, and what they got wrong.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to discuss your papers in length with you if I have concerns.</p>

<p>Credit hours will be earned by attending two classes of <span class="math inline">\(1.3\bar{3}\)</span> hours each, reading and preparing written work outside of class for 6 to 9 hours per week, and a series of incremental assignments building to a highly-polished op-ed style critique of an organization’s approach to climate policy.

<ul>
<li>If you do not submit a revised version of your op-ed(s) on time, I will re-submit your previous version for review on your behalf. This will make sure you still get feedback on your work. If you submit by the end of the week, I will award partial points, but your reviewer is not expected to wait for the revised version to submit their review.</li>
<li>Late reviews are unfair to your classmates. If you do not submit a peer review on time, I will submit a review on your behalf, and you will not receive points for that review.</li>

<h1>📖 Reading by Week</h1>
<p>🎧 Most weeks include audio content, either in addition to or as an alternative to required reading. Pay attention to the minutes assigned. Some podcasts keep going, and you don’t need to keep listening.</p>
<p>If you hit a paywall on a link from the syllabus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look to see if it says <code>(Canvas)</code> next to it. These readings should be in the “files/readings” folder on Canvas. If they are not, please let me know ASAP.<br>
</li>
<li>Make sure that you are logged in to get library access to journals. You can also search for the journal on the library website.<br>
</li>
<li>If 1 &amp; 2 don’t work, please let me know ASAP so that I can make sure you all have access. Sometimes, paywalls don’t pop up for me because of some cached credentials, and I don’t realize that the content is paywalled. You should not have to pay for any of the online content for this course.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many “further” readings, and some required readings (especially the longer academic articles) say “skim.” Here is advice on <a href="https://www.ameliahoovergreen.com/uploads/9/3/0/9/93091546/howtoread.pdf">how to read political science from Amelia Hoover Green</a> and <a href="https://www.jessicacalarco.com/tips-tricks/2018/9/2/beyond-the-abstract-reading-for-meaning-in-academia">how to skim from Jessica Calarco</a>.</p>
<p>There are some questions we will ask of every reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the author’s argument?</li>
<li>What do you think about it?</li>
<li>Does it apply elsewhere?</li>
<li>What does it imply for what we should do?</li>
</ul>

<p>“The hope is that the [Inflation Reduction Act’s] bundle of subsidies, tax breaks, infrastructure investment, and market protectionism will unite green-tech boosters with big capital, organized labor, and the beneficiaries of the growth-to-come. If this coalition-building is successful, more green-industrial policy will ensue…Climate is reshaping the terrain on which we will be fighting in the years to come.” (Battistoni and Mann)</p>

<p>Note: This week, we are hearing from fairly mainstream policy people who work in similar circles (except for Battistoni and Mann’s critique from the labor left). You should not take agreement among them as evidence that there is broad political agreement on all of these things; it is just a function of what I assigned, which is a function of who happens to be in the room where climate policy is being made today. In future weeks, we will read a broader range of perspectives, but I think we need to start here to understand where we are today before we dive deeper into how we got here in weeks 3-7 and where we might go from here in weeks 8-14.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-14-planning-for-change">Week 14: Planning for Change</h2>
<!--Learning Objectives
-Understand the basic role of local governments in planning and development. 
- Understand how planners control individuals of individual parcels of land but must constantly deal with broader economic and social forces at work in an urban area.
-Understand different planning approaches:  top-down and bottom-up planning, consensus planning, and centralized and fragmenting budgeting.
-Understand the planning paradox:  making decisions attuned to the interests of existing stakeholders and planning to change the urban area to adapt to changing economic, environmental, and social forces.
-Understand how climate change affects different cities’ environments and economies and, thus, changes the agendas of city governments.
-Understand the linkages between cities and surrounding suburban and rural areas.   How do cities affect the economies of surrounding areas?  How do cities depend on these surrounding areas? How do these surrounding areas (especially suburbs) rely on cities? How do land use changes in surrounding areas lead to changes in cities?  

Adaptation planning 
Learning Objectives
-Explain the meaning of vulnerability, risk, and resilience planning and provide examples
-Differentiate between mitigation and adaptation and how they can relate to each other
-Identify technologies that could help with adaptation and the challenges behind their adaptation.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-information-on-student-instructor-best-practices">More Information on Student Instructor Best Practices</h2>
<p>We will conduct office hours with my door open unless you request otherwise.</p>
<p>Students who wish to have confidential conversations with me may schedule a private meeting via Zoom or may ask to have a closed-door meeting. But this closed-door meeting must be made on your request in writing, even on the spot. I will never suggest a closed-door meeting myself because of the power dynamic.</p>
<p>We will document all pre-scheduled meetings between the instructor and the student via Google Calendar (or other software) and/or university email.</p>
<p>Students who email to request an office hour appointment should expect to receive an email confirmation or a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation from me, or, upon my email confirmation and request, may send me a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation for this meeting. The purpose is to provide a permanent record of the meeting and to ensure that all class activities are documented and transparent. Students who choose to drop by for informal meetings are welcome to do so, but there will be no documentation provided. (See above for open-door policy.)</p>
<p>We will choose meeting locations and conduct meetings with student and instructor safety in mind.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all individual meetings between instructor/student will take place at university venues.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all off-campus meetings, trips, or events must engage with course material.</p>
<p>Off-campus meetings will not involve alcohol or take place at locations that serve alcohol. If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).</p>
<p>We, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.</p>
<p>There will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.</p>
