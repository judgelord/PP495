<h1>🗺️ Objectives</h1>
<p>In the past century—the blink of an eye in ecological time—a small portion of humans concentrated in wealthier and more industrialized countries began to radically transform the ecology of our planet at an unprecedented scale.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This class aims to help you develop your own critique of various policy fights over what to do about our new relationship with our biosphere.</p>
<p>Experts increasingly see the slow policy response to climate science as having less to do with climate science and technology and more to do with politics. That is, climate change is increasingly seen as a problem for the social sciences to address. Thus, this class is about politics. “Politics” can mean many things, and a core objective of this class is understanding different forms of politics—different ways of having and resolving debates about who our community is and what we will do together about the challenges we face. <!--Climate policy debates reflect well-established political and economic perspectives but also raise new, unique issues. --></p>
<p>The core readings are mostly drawn from political science, political theory, and law. They are accompanied by op-eds and podcasts from advocates and journalists covering climate policy debates. Both the theories of politics and political arguments cover a wide range of perspectives. We will read a range of critiques based on different visions of good politics—from left to right, religious to utilitarian, populist to technocratic—with the aim of recognizing and critiquing these forms of politics when we see them in the wild. While we will mainly focus on policy debates in the United States, the underlying political struggles can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>The assignments for this class are motivated by the observation that politics is fundamentally an organized activity. Thus, the critiques we develop in this class will target organizations. In your opinion, are they choosing the right battles? Are they taking the right positions? Are they framing the issues in the most effective way? Is their theory of change (or resistance to change) realistic?</p>
<p>Critiquing those with whom we severely disagree is easy, but they are also the least likely to listen to you. Thus, the critiques you develop in this class will be aimed at the organizations you see as having the best chance of making a positive difference in the world—specifically, the organizations for whom you hope to work or volunteer. You may not know what your future career looks like; that is fine. Perhaps you will find an organization or cause that inspires you in this class. Or perhaps you have a very clear idea of your future career. In that case, this class will challenge you to think about how organizations in your intended field of work engage in politics and policymaking—and how they might do so differently. It is not a requirement that the organizations you address are activist organizations. Indeed, activist organizations may be the most difficult to critique because they already have a well-developed approach to politics and policy. You may even see yourself working for an organization that is currently strongly opposed to most proposed climate policies; that is fine. For example, if you aim to work at Exxon-Mobil, you might look to Business School scholarship to formulate a critique like <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_put_the_fossil_fuel_industry_into_hospice">this one</a>.</p>
<p>As practice for developing your skills in both effective writing and constructive criticism, peer critiques of your colleagues’ writing are a major part of this class and of your grade.</p>
<section id="course-philosophy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-philosophy">∴ Course Philosophy</h2>
<p>In designing this course, I proceed from several premises:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is worth knowing the <strong>history</strong> of our current policy debates and the <strong>ideas and values</strong> that the rhetoric of these policy debates evokes.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more interesting to explore <strong>serious proposals</strong> about what to do than people arguing against doing anything. That said, there are lots of ideas about what to do, and many don’t agree. I just don’t give a ton of time to defenders of the status quo, especially to the extent that they intentionally use obfuscating rhetoric—I don’t want this class to be a victim of efforts to sow confusion. Thus, I focus on authors with the most earnest, sincere, and uncompromised statements of what to do and why. For example, big business lobbyists and public relations firms significantly shape our current debate, but we ought to take what they say is good for the environment with a huge grain of salt because they are not primarily interested in our relationship with our biosphere; they aim to help their clients make money by spinning what is good for business as good for the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more interesting to explore <strong>deeply rooted ideas</strong> and see them in rhetoric than to stay at the level of rhetoric. This class is about politics and policy and only secondarily about rhetoric and communications. I don’t want us to limit our thinking to what plays well in current mass media or elite discourse. I want you to develop a position on how you think politics should be reshaped and how we should balance competing values. Then, let that inform your analysis of the rhetoric.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Humans are having a significant impact on the biosphere</strong>. I don’t have much about climate change <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oreskes-supran-exxonmobil-20170901-story.html">denialism</a> on the syllabus. Mainstream policy debates have moved passed outright denialism. Even the incumbent industry talking points have moved on from denial and even away from doubt and minimizing. They now acknowledge climate science and cast themselves as helping to address it, sow skepticism that policies they dislike will work, slow policymaking behind the scenes, deflect responsibility, and focus on personal responsibility and other forms of <a href="#purdy.html#anti-politics">anti-politics</a>. The <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/merchants-of-doubt-9781608193943/">merchants of doubt</a> have <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2018.1439353">shifted from attacking science to attacking policies</a> as too uncertain, too expensive, and unnecessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual action is good but insufficient; <strong>collective action (and thus politics) is required</strong>. This class is in the public policy school, and I am a political scientist. We are here to learn about the many different kinds of policy and politics proposed to address climate change, not argue about whether policy and politics, in general, are useful for solving problems.</p></li>

<h1>🏛️ Learning Environment</h1>
<p>Learning from each other is only possible if we show the respect due to our fellow citizens of this class.</p>
<p>To realize this goal, I expect us to respect our colleagues and cultivate inclusive discussions. This means that we must be careful not to mislead, degrade, interrupt someone who does not speak as much, or enforce hierarchies based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, or ability.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuq2jfmbpflm4f2/FINAL%202023%20Masters%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">MPP</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhllbd4vpfr439r/FINAL%202023%20BA%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">BA</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/06x1tzt1e32pjjw/FINAL%202023%20PHD%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">Ph.D.&nbsp;Program</a> handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at <a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11#112">U-M’s academic-policies page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Technology:</strong> Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first have informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and, in some cases, your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.</p>

<section id="tools-that-generate-text" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tools-that-generate-text">🛠️ Tools That Generate Text</h2>
<p>You learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the crafts of constructive critique and persuasive writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft arguments and recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking a <a href="https://blog.quintarelli.it/2019/11/lets-forget-the-term-ai-lets-call-them-systematic-approaches-to-learning-algorithms-and-machine-inferences-salami/">SALAMI</a>. I expect the same.</p>
<p>Text extruded by large language models (LLMs) is, by construction, derivative of patterns of words already linked together on the internet. In some sense, everything we do is derivative of our experiences, but the generative process is very different for thinking subjects (you) than for a pre-trained language model. Language models are [excellent at helping us conform to grammar conventions<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but incapable of producing original critiques. If they produce something that sounds insightful, it is only because we are able to assign meaning to the strings of words they extrude. (It also probably sounds right because it resembles things already written by a human on the internet.) Language models have no sense of meaning and cannot judge the consistency, coherence, or logic of an argument. I expect the critiques you produce to be yours and for you to stand by them as intellectual projects. No LLM can help you justify your thought process and reasoning. LLMs have no thought process and do not reason. Language is always in flux, but I see “reasoning” and “intelligence” are misnomers when applied to LLMs.</p>
<p>Beyond grammar conventions, I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of persuasive writing or for learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich white men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts. Uncritically using LLMs trained on biased source material risks reproducing those biases.</p>
<p>Good policy and political strategy rest on good evidence. LLMs can fabricate evidence. Even when the sources are real, unless it is an exact quote, LLMs cannot guarantee a reasonable link between a claim and a source (LLMs don’t reason), only a statistically probable word order. Extruded text is often sensible, but there is no guarantee. Be careful. Work submitted with <mark>fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0</mark> for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make work worse than worthless. <!--The key recommendation of experts studying how students can effectively use LLMs is to craft a solid bibliography first and constrain generative tools to those sources. You will still have to do significant work to make sure that sources are used and cited appropriately, but this is much easier than finding real evidence to replace fake evidence and *then* making sure it is used and cited correctly.--><br>
Thus, <mark><strong>references must be hyperlinked</strong></mark> whenever possible; I will check to make sure sources of evidence are used appropriately.</p>
<p>If you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used them for, what they got right, and what they got wrong.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to discuss your papers in length with you if I have concerns that technological crutches are hindering your learning.</p>

<section id="assignments" class="level1">
<h1>🪶 Assignments</h1>
<p>Credit hours will be earned by attending two classes of <span class="math inline">\(1.3\bar{3}\)</span> hours each, reading and preparing written work outside of class for 6 to 9 hours per week, and a series of incremental assignments building to a highly-polished op-ed style critique of an organization’s approach to climate policy. A key part of the process will be critiquing the writing of others. Detailed instructions for each assignment are available in the <a href="assignments">assignment guide</a>.</p>
<p>Most weeks, the assignments are incremental steps to your final op-ed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In week 6, you will write a reflection on how you have experienced climate politics. This should mirror Mary Annaïse Heglar’s essay, Home is Always Worth It, but can be significantly shorter (200-800 words).</p>
<p>In week 12, you will write a reflection on how you carry with you different world views/ways of seeing nature/forms of environmental imagination/paradigms and how they shape your thinking. This should mirror Purdy’s self-reflection in the introduction of <em>After Nature</em> by including the four world views we read about, but it may also include others (including, perhaps, some of the new emerging visions discussed in Chapter 7) (200-800 words).</p>

<p>Because nearly all assignments are either revised versions of previous submissions that someone else must review on a tight timeline or peer reviews that your peers depend on in order to make revisions on a tight timeline, late work is not an option.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not submit a revised version of your op-ed(s) on time, I will resubmit your previous version for review on your behalf. This will make sure you still get feedback on your work. If you submit by the end of the week, I will award partial points, but your reviewer is not expected to wait for the revised version to submit their review.</li>
<li>Late reviews are unfair to your classmates. If you do not submit a peer review on time, I will submit a review on your behalf, and you will not receive points for that review.</li>
</ul>

<p><mark>Discussion questions are graded</mark> on a 0-3 scale.</p>
<p>Advice on writing good questions from Professor Rohde:</p>
<p>Questions should model good intellectual practice; that is, not just a one-sentence question, but a few sentences providing some important framing or context. This could include, for example, an explanation of why the question is important (the stakes), an elaboration on the nuances of the question, etc. Reference to specific language in the text(s) is encouraged, and quotes are welcome. For material on the syllabus, simply cite the author and page; for materials beyond the syllabus, please include a full reference.</p>
<p>Types of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification/Comprehension (e.g., What does X mean? — This should not be answered with a quick internet search — an internet search yielding contradictory plausible answers is evidence that it is a good question)</li>
<li>Analytical/Interpretive (e.g., How does X evidence relate to Y point?)</li>
<li>Synthetic/Evaluative (e.g., Are you convinced by the author’s argument that X? ) If you choose this question, be sure to say why the argument is provocative or has important implications. If you think a statement is obviously correct or trivial, then it is not worth discussing whether we agree with it.</li>
<li>Connective/Comparative (e.g., How does X’s argument compare to Y’s we read last week?) If you choose this question, point us in the direction of some key similarities or differences.</li>
<li>Provocative/Argumentative (e.g., Doesn’t evidence X undermine author’s point Y?!)</li>
<li>Applied/Extended (e.g., Does X point help explain current problem Y?) If you choose this question, be sure to indicate why or how the comparison is relevant. I.e., don’t use this as a mindless invitation to extend an analysis across policy problems.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Here are some example discussion questions based on the readings from Week 2:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Clarification] Battistoni and Mann argue that the Biden Administration’s linking of concerns about climate and the rising power of China led to “the legitimation of a mode of state capitalism that would have been unthinkable in the inner circles of American policymaking a few years ago.” I am a bit confused by the jargon here. My understanding is that this is what they mean by “Bidenomics,” but they also talk about “Bidenomics” as “industrial policy” when talking about the IRA. Do “state capitalism” and “industrial policy” mean the same thing here? Or can you have one without the other? Finally, how does this relate to the concept of “political capitalism” discussed at the beginning of the article?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Analytical] Contrasting investments in green infrastructure with proposed policies targeting child care that were cut from the IRA, Battistoni and Mann ask, “Why did [green infrastructure investments] squeak through, while proposed investments in ‘care infrastructure’ and other social welfare programs were abandoned?” I am not sure which of the answers they offer is the better explanation. They seem to offer two answers: (1) that Biden was pursuing “a classic strategy of (re)industrialization” and (2) that Senator Manchin’s “decisive role in the IRA’s passage means that it relies almost entirely on incentives for investments in green tech.” Which is more to blame? Biden’s priorities or Manchin’s? What evidence do we have either way?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Evaluative] Battistoni and Mann provocatively argue that “there is little to distinguish the IRA’s ‘carrots-only’ strategy from Obama’s notorious ‘all of the above’ energy policy.” I think I see what they are saying, but I don’t think it is accurate. I also think it contradicts their main argument about how we have entered a new era of climate politics. Are you persuaded that Obama and Biden’s climate policy strategies are more similar than they are different? [For context, recall that the two most prominent features of Obama’s climate policy were the Clean Power Plan regulations on power plants and the Waxman-Markey cap and trade bill.] In what sense is this statement persuasive? In what sense is it not? More generally, much has been made (including in this article) about the new era of industrial policy. In what sense is it new? In what sense is it more of the same?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Connective] In the Volts podcast about the Farm Bill, we learned that U.S. ag policy resembles the “industrial policy” that the other readings used to describe the energy policy of both the Biden and Trump administrations. This made me curious about the connections between these two kinds of policy. Are there insights from how ag policy has developed and how political coalitions have formed that suggest what we can expect to see in energy policy, where fuel sources are increasingly shaped by the state, similar to how our food sources have been for decades? Are there fundamental differences in ag and energy policy, politics, or industry that make them difficult to compare? Or is there a version of the Farm bill that could emerge for Energy? Can we imagine what a regular bipartisan 5-year Energy Bill would look like? What are the political coalitions for this?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Provocative] Several of this week’s readings talked about the political theory of why various IRA policies should create durable political collections (e.g., Battistoni and Mann and the interview with Sonia Aggarwal). Yet, Harris did not campaign much on climate, Trump was elected on platform that included repealing the IRA, and (despite most of the money going to their districts) nearly every Republican member of Congress voted to scrap most IRA provisions. Is the lesson that the political strategy of the IRA to build a durable coalition and “lock-in” policy is a failure? To what extent should we conclude that the underlying theory of what makes a policy durable is wrong? To take a step back, what exactly was the theory of why IRA provisions would not be repealed? Why did so many people think this? Does the evidence we have from the debates over its repeal undermine the theory?</p>

<p>You get two days to take a pass on posting a discussion question and/or participating in class. Even if you are taking a pass on participation, I hope you will still come to class. If you are taking a pass and don’t want me to call you into the conversation, just let me know ahead of time.</p>
<p>Pass days will initially appear as “0” on Canvas, but I will adjust participation points when I calculate your final scores in Canvas.</p>
<p>Beyond your two pass days, I allow you to make up two additional days:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you know that you will miss class, write a <code>1-page reflection</code> on the readings and share it with the class <strong>with your discussion post.</strong></li>
<li>If you unexpectedly miss class, post a <code>1-page reflection on the readings **AND schedule a time to discuss the readings with me**</code> (ideally, during office hours)</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond four missed classes (two passes, two make-ups), I only allow make-ups in very extenuating circumstances. Participation is a core part of this class, and the entire class is deprived of your perspective when you are not with us.</p>

<h1>📖 Reading by Week</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Each week’s required readings are indented and marked with a grey sidebar. I also often note “resources” or “further readings” with bullets—these are not required readings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🎧 Most weeks include audio content, either in addition to or as an alternative to required reading. Pay attention to the minutes assigned. Some podcasts keep going, and you don’t need to keep listening.</p>
<p>I have intentionally put a wide range of perspectives on the syllabus, sometimes in conversation (see weeks on justice, markets, nationalism, and movements).</p>
<p>There are some questions we will ask of every reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the author’s argument?</li>
<li>What do you think about it?</li>
<li>Does it apply elsewhere?</li>
<li>What does it imply for what we should do?</li>
</ul>
<p>Come to class ready to answer these questions.</p>
<p>If you hit a paywall on a link from the syllabus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look to see if it says <code>(Canvas-&gt;Perusall)</code> next to it. These readings should be on Perusall <!-- in the "files/readings" folder on Canvas.--> If they are not, please let me know ASAP.<br>
</li>
<li>Make sure that you are logged in to get library access to journals. You can also search for the journal on the library website.<br>
</li>
<li>If 1 &amp; 2 don’t work, please let me know ASAP so that I can make sure you all have access. Sometimes, paywalls don’t pop up for me because of some cached credentials, and I don’t realize that the content is paywalled. You should not pay for any of the online content for this course. There are many “further” readings, and some required readings (especially the longer academic articles) say “skim.” Here is advice on <a href="https://www.ameliahoovergreen.com/uploads/9/3/0/9/93091546/howtoread.pdf">how to read political science from Amelia Hoover Green</a> and <a href="https://www.jessicacalarco.com/tips-tricks/2018/9/2/beyond-the-abstract-reading-for-meaning-in-academia">how to skim from Jessica Calarco</a>.</li>

<p>This week, we are hearing from fairly mainstream policy people who work in similar circles (except for Battistoni and Mann’s critique from the labor left). You should not take agreement among them as evidence that there is broad political agreement on all of these things; it is just a function of what I assigned, which is a function of who happens to be in the room where climate policy is being made today. In future weeks, we will read a broader range of perspectives, but I think we need to start here to understand where we are today before we dive deeper into how we got here in weeks 3-7 and where we might go from here in weeks 8-14.</p>

## Week 4: God and Nature

The religious, colonial, and mystic foundations of Western environmental law and politics: 


> "The Settlers of the nineteenth-century frontier, clearing and sowing a continental garden, took to heart John Locke's insistence that 'God wants us to do something' and that nature revealed the intended tasks...And for the Romantics who created the Sierra Club, nature's beauty was evidence that awe and admiration, not just usefulness, were parts of the human purpose. God wanted us not just to do something, but also to stand there---and look." (Purdy, p. 199)


### Tuesday

> Purdy, Chapter 1: An Unequal Terrain (51-70) and Chapter 2: God's Avid Gardeners (70-95) 

### Thursday 

> Purdy, Chapter 4: Natural Utopias (116-152)

The black church as a site of modern climate advocacy:

<p>Way, Ives, Mealy, and Farmer find that renewable energy costs are falling so fast that a fast transition scenario saves $12 trillion in energy costs relative to the status quo. In the podcast, Farmer says “There are no impediments to rolling out the hardware and building what we need to build. The impediments are political. We do have a powerful industry that is trying to keep it from happening because it threatens their existence.”</p>

<p>Battistoni asks if it is possible to increase people’s quality of life while decreasing our impact on the environment (i.e., producing and consuming less material stuff). She finds answers in the feminist concept of care work. Her argument has many clear policy implications.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Capitalism depends on the socially reproductive labor of the household, and by calling that work an act of love, makes it free…As with Wages for Housework, in which the concrete demand for payment acted as a provocative starting point, the demand for payment for work done to and by ecosystems was originally meant as an unsettling metaphor.” (Battistoni, <em>Alive in the Sunshine</em>)</p>

<li>In “Alive in the Sunshine,” Battistoni presents two ways of seeing the movement for Payment for Ecosystem Services. What are their ideological roots? What are the implications of each for climate policy?</li>

<li>Reducing harm/injustices to indigenous peoples</li>
<li>Indigenous participation/consent</li>
<li>Indigenous leadership</li>
<li>Self-governance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whyte mainly discusses decisions affecting Indigenous lands, while Tunks focuses on Indigenous voice in settler policy processes (including international policymaking). What is the main argument for these two situations? <!--
- "Indigenous lands" are contested. Settler governments often ignore provisions of treaties, and many treaties were made under threat of violence. --></li>
<li>What are the implications of expanding or shrinking Indigenous governance for addressing climate change?</li>
<li>Conversely, what are the implications of various climate policies for indigenous governance?</li>

<!--Learning Objectives
-Understand the basic role of local governments in planning and development. 
- Understand how planners control individuals of individual parcels of land but must constantly deal with broader economic and social forces at work in an urban area.
-Understand different planning approaches:  top-down and bottom-up planning, consensus planning, and centralized and fragmenting budgeting.
-Understand the planning paradox:  making decisions attuned to the interests of existing stakeholders and planning to change the urban area to adapt to changing economic, environmental, and social forces.
-Understand how climate change affects different cities’ environments and economies and, thus, changes the agendas of city governments.
-Understand the linkages between cities and surrounding suburban and rural areas.   How do cities affect the economies of surrounding areas?  How do cities depend on these surrounding areas? How do these surrounding areas (especially suburbs) rely on cities? How do land use changes in surrounding areas lead to changes in cities?  

Adaptation planning 
Learning Objectives
-Explain the meaning of vulnerability, risk, and resilience planning, and provide examples
-Differentiate between mitigation and adaptation, and how they can relate to each other
-Identify technologies that could help with adaptation and the challenges behind their adaptation.

<p>We will conduct office hours with my door open unless you request otherwise.</p>
<p>Students who wish to have confidential conversations with me may schedule a private meeting via Zoom or may ask to have a closed-door meeting. But this closed-door meeting must be made on your request in writing, even on the spot. I will never suggest a closed-door meeting myself because of the power dynamic.</p>
<p>We will document all pre-scheduled meetings between the instructor and the student via Google Calendar (or other software) and/or university email.</p>
<p>Students who email to request an office hour appointment should expect to receive an email confirmation or a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation from me, or, upon my email confirmation and request, may send me a Google Calendar (or other software) invitation for this meeting. The purpose is to provide a permanent record of the meeting and to ensure that all class activities are documented and transparent. Students who choose to drop by for informal meetings are welcome to do so, but there will be no documentation provided. (See above for open-door policy.)</p>
<p>We will choose meeting locations and conduct meetings with student and instructor safety in mind.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all individual meetings between the instructor/student will take place at university venues.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all off-campus meetings, trips, or events engage with the course material.</p>
<p>Off-campus meetings will not involve alcohol or take place at locations that serve alcohol. If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).</p>
<p>We, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.</p>
<p>There will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.</p>
