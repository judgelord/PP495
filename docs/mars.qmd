> The Destiny of Earthseed  
is to take root among the stars.    
It is to live and to thrive   
on new earths.    
It is to become new beings    
and to consider new questions.    
It is to leap into the heavens     
again and again.   
It is to explore the vastness.  
Of heaven.

- [Yale Professor advocates for mini-publics on mars](https://www.ft.com/content/f0d95e10-ca83-47f4-9c06-3eab19261ab4)
- [VOX article on Elon Musk's views](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11852148/elon-musk-mars-government-direct-democracy) (I apologize for giving him such a prominent role in these slides. Just because he has money and fame does not mean his ideas are any good.)



If you want to go down a rabbit hole: 

- Searching for examples of public discourse around democracy on mars, I found a [lawfirm](https://www.greeneconomylaw.com/) specializing in green startups and their blog about [law on mars](https://www.lawonmars.com/government-of-mars)

More seriously, I recommend Kim Stanley Robinson's Ministry for the Future and Mars Trilogy.
